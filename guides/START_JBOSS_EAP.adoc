= Start the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Server

Before you deploy a quickstart using the Maven command line tool, in most cases you need a running Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform server. A few of the Arquillian tests do not require a running server. This will be noted in the `README` file for that quickstart.

The JBoss EAP server can be started the following ways.

* xref:start_the_default_jboss_eap_server[Start the Default JBoss EAP Server]: This is the default configuration. It defines minimal subsystems and services.
* xref:start_the_jboss_eap_server_with_the_full_profile[Start the JBoss EAP Server with the Full Profile]: This profile configures many of the commonly used subsystems and services.
* xref:start_the_jboss_eap_server_with_custom_configuration_options[Start the JBoss EAP Server with Custom Configuration Options]: Custom configuration parameters can be specified on the command line when starting the server.

The README for each quickstart specifies which configuration is required to run the example.

A few xref:examples_of_commands_to_start_the_jboss_eap_server[examples of commands to start the JBoss EAP server] are displayed at the end of this guide.

NOTE: See link:USE_OF_EAP_HOME.adoc[Use of __EAP_HOME__] for information about the JBoss EAP installation path.
